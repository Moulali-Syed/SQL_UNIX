Test Design Techiniques:
used to prepare data for testing
1.data
2.coverage

with less data and more coverage

we have 5 types of test design techiniques
Equivalence Class partioning
Boundary Value ANalysis
Decision table based testing
state transition
error guessing

===============================================================================================================
Equivalence class partioning:
partition data into various classes and can select data according to class then test . it reduce number of testcases and saves time for testing
value check
classify/divide /partition data

enter  a number: textbox [allowa digits from 1-500]

normal testdata			divide values into equivalence classes          Testdata using ECP
1					-100 to 0 -> -50(Invalid)					-50
2					1-100 ->30(valid)							30
3					101-200-->160(valid)						160
4					201-300---> 250(Valid) 						250
.					301-400 --> 320(Valid)						320
.					401-500 --> 450(Valid)						450
.					501-600 -->550(Invalid)						550

..
.
500

textbox accepts only alphabets
divide values into equivalence classes:
								Testdata
A...Z(Valid)						XYZ
a...z(valid)						zxa
SpecialCharacters->(Invalid)				@#$%
Spaces->250(Inalvd)					Xy z
Numbers ->320						1234
===============================================================================================================

Boundary Value Analysis:
BVA is used to check boundaries of input , checks the boundary values

enter age: textbox   [allows digit from 18-35]

Min-1=17 min=18 min+1=18        max-1 =34   max=35  max+1=36


input Domain Testing:
The value will be verified in text box /input fields
we use ECP and BVA techniques


===============================================================================================================

Decision Table:

is also called cause - effect table
this technique will be used if we have more conditions and corresponsing actions
in decison table technique we deal with combinations of inputs
to identify testcases with decision table , we consider conditions and actions

Decision table example:
Take an example of transferring money online to an account which is already added and approved

here conditions to transer money are
Account already approved
OTP matched
Sufficient money in account

And actions perfromed are
transfer money
show a message as insuffuicient amount
block transaction incase of suspicious transaction
							TC1 		TC2 		TC3		TC4 		TC5

condition1 : account already apprved     True		True		True		True		false
consitin2:   OTP matched 			true		true		false		false		 X
condition3:  sufficinet money in account  true        false		true		false		 X
action1		transfer money		execute
action2	show message insuffient amount		execute
action3 block transaction incase of suspicious tran			execute	execute	X


if we have more number of conditions /actions then we use decision table techinque
===============================================================================================================

State Tranisition:
this technique chnages in input conditions chnage the state of application
this testing technique allows tester to test behaviour of an AUT
tester can perform this action by entering various input conditions in a sequence
testing team provides positive as well as negative input test values for evaluating system behaviour

take an example of login page of an application which locks user name after three wrong attempts of password

STATE  login								corect pwd		incorrect pwd
s1	 firstattempt							S4			S2
s2 	 second attempt							S4			S3
s3 	 third attempt							S4			S5
s4 	 home page
s5	 display message as "accont locked ,please consult administrator"

===============================================================================================================

Error Guessing:

error guessing is one of testing techniques to find bugs in software application
we dont have any specific rules
it depends on tester analytical skills and experience
some of examples are:
submitting a form without entering values
entering invalid values such as entering aplhabets in numeric fields
