Read document clearly and write test cases

System Testing: our key focus is on below 4 categories
GUI Testing
Usability Testing
Functional Testing
NonFunctional testing
=======================================================================================================
GUI Testing:
is process of testing user interface of an application
A GUI includes all elements such as menus , checkbox,buttons, colors , fonts , sizes, icons , content and images

GUI testing checklist
The communication between UI and database working fine or not
testing size position , width , height of elements
testing error messages that are getting displayed
testing different sections on screen
testing font whether it is readable or not
testing screen in different resolution with help of zooimg in and zoomin out
testing alignments of text , other elements like icons , buttons etc are in proper place or not
testing colors of fonts
testing whether image has good clarity or not
testing alignment of images
testing the spelling
the user must not get frustrated while using system interface
testing whether interface is attractive or not
testing scrollbars according to size of page if any
testing disabled fields if any
testing size of images
testing headings whether it is properly aligned or not
testing color if hyperlink
testing UI elements like button,textbox , textarea , checkbox , radio button, drop downs , links etc.

=======================================================================================================
Usability testing:
during this testing validates application provided context sensitive help or not to user
checks how easily the end users are able to understand and operate the application is called usability testing

=======================================================================================================
Functional testing : main focus in system testing , focus on requirements of customer
Functionality is behaviour of application
talks about how your feature should work
	Object properties testing , database testing , error handling, calculations/Manipulation testing , links existence and links execution , cookies and sessions

Object properties testing:
Every element on UI must have some properties 
like a textbox - enable /disable
	radio button - 
	drop down - select one element
	combo boxes - select multiple elements
	focus - once we write in textbox and press enter focus going to next input element

Database/end end testing: grey box testing , table level validations (columnType , columnLength,NumberOfColumns,relation Between Tables, Triggers, Indexes,Views , etc..)
check DML - Data manipulation langauge
insert, update, delete,select

sending data from UI checking in db - grey box testing

Error Handling:
when incorect actions are done , error messages must be proper and readable ,simple and understandable
Incorrect data
Incorrect user(more specific)

Calculations/Manipulation Testing:
check calculations with valid and invalid data

links:
where exactly links are placed - links are navigating to proper page or not
we have internal links , external links , broken links

Cookies
temporary files created by browser while browsing pages through internet

Sessions:
time slots created by server . session will be expired after sometime(if you are idle for sometime)
=======================================================================================================
Non Functional Testing: focus on expectation of customer
once application functionality is stable then we do
focus on performance , load it can take and security etc

Performance testing: speed of application , how well app responds to many users
	Load testing
	Stress testing
	Volume testing

		load testing: lets say we have server , we slowly increase number of users and check the application speed - JMeter ,LoadRunner
		Stress testing: we suddenly increase or decrease load on application
		Volume Testing: how much data application can handle

Security Testing:
how secure our application , 
Authentication -- users are valid or not
Authorization/Access COntrol  -- only has access to some functionality , permissions of valid user

Recovery testing:
check the system change from abnormal to normal

Compatibility Testing:
forward compatiablity 
backward compatiblity
Hardware compatibility(configuration testing)

Installation Testing:
Check screens are clear to understand
Screens Navigation
simple or not
Uninstallation

Sanitation/Garbage Testing:
If any application provides extra features / functinality the we can consider them as bug

=======================================================================================================

differences between Functional and Non Functional Testing:
Functional TEsting

validates functinality of software
functionality describes what software does
concentrates on user requirement
functional testing takes place before non functional testing


NonFunctional testing
verify the performance security reliablity of software
non functionality describes how software works
concentrates on user expectation
non functional testing performed after finishing functional testing
