Project vs Product:
If software application is developed for specific customer based on the requirement then it is called project , they work for specific clients - service based companies
If software application is developed for multiple customers based on market requirements then it is called Product , google ,Microsoft , Oracle - Product based companies

Error: Incorrect Human action
Bug: It is a deviation from actual behaviour , suppose if data is valid and able to login , if data invalid must not able to login ,if this doesnot happen then it is BUG/Defect
Failure:This will be seen in Production environment , customer usage


Why software has bugs?
Miscommunication or no communication
Software Complexity
Programming errors
Changing Requirements
Lack of skilled testers
