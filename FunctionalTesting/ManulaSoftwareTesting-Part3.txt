Static Testing Techniques:
1.Review
		Read entire documents  thus ensure correctness and completeness , can be written by anyone
		we have requirement reviews , design reviews , code reviews , test plan reviews , test cases review , defect review .. etc
2.Walkthrough
		It is informal review
		author reads document or code and discuss with peers
		its not preplanned can be done when ever required
		also wlakthrough doesnot have minutes of meet

3.Inspection

		It is most formal review type
		in which at least 3-8 people will sit in meeting 1.reader , 2.writer[writes if any questions raised] , 3.moderator[organizer] plus concerned
		Inspection will have proper schedule which will be intimated via email to concerned developer/tester
Static testing is testing the documents using above 3 ways

Dynamic Testing Techniques:
Unit testing        - code is available done by developers
Integration testing - code is available done by developers
System testing  -  done by testers to check the functionality of application
User acceptance testing
===============================================================================================================================================================

QA - quality assurance  vs QC - quality control

QA is process related , in a company we have people,process,product
ensure and define that all follow the qality techniques , QA involved in entire software develeopment life cycle
QA focus on building quality product
QA is for preventing defects
QA - is process oriented
QA for entire life cycle

QC - actual testing of software [Testers]
QC focuses on testing for quality
QC is detecting defects
QC is product oriented
QC for testing part in SDLC

QE - Quality Engineering , writes code to test the software - automation testers will be QE
SE - write code to create software

===============================================================================================================================================================
Levels of Software testing:
Unit Testing  -  test the code 
Integration Testing - combining multiple units and check the flow
System testing - test over all functinality of application , thus matching with requirements or not
User Acceptance testing(UAT)  - testers along with users do them

Unit Testing:
As soon as coding started developer will do unit testing
A unit is a single component or module of a software
unit testing conducts on a single program or single module
unit testing is white box testing technique conducted by developers
Unit testing Techniques:
Basis path testing  - each and every line of code is covered and tested
control structure testing - 
	a=10 b=20
	if(a>b)
		print a is large
	else
		b is large
conditional coverage
loops coverage
mutation testing

===============================================================================================================================================================
Integration testing:
performed between 2 or more modules
focuses on checking data communication between multiple modules
Integration testing is white box testing

Types of Integration testing:
1.incremental integration testing: incrementally adding modules and check the data flow between modules
  we have two approaches , top down and bottom up
  Top Down - Incremental Integration testing
	parent to child , like compose --> sent items
	incrementally adding modules and check the data flow between modules , ensure the module added is child of previous module
  Bottom up - incrementally adding modules and check the data flow between modules , ensure module added is parent of previous module
      child - parent , like sentItems --> compose
   Sandwich/Hybrid approach - combination of top down and bottom up

2.Non Incremental Integration Testing
   adding all modules in a single shot and test data flow between modules
	drawbacks: we might miss data flow between some of modules
			if u find defect we cant understand root cause of defect

===============================================================================================================================================================
System testing:
Testing over all functionality of application with respect to client requirements
It is black box testing
this is conducted by testing team
after completion of component and integration level testing we start system testing
before conducting system testing  we should know customer requirements
System Testing focuses on below aspects
User interface testing (GUI)
functional testing
non functional testing
usability testing
===============================================================================================================================================================
User Acceptance testing
UAT team conducts testing in two levels
Alpha testing
Beta Testing
