Input, Output , Error Redirection:


default Input device is keyboard or command line arguments
default output device is terminal
standard error device - terminal


when ever we get error it will display in terminal but i want to redirect the output in some other file
we can use redirection

output redirection:  use > or >>   1
error redirection : > or  >>	     2
input redirection: <		     0

output redirection:
==================
symbol used > or >>
error device representing : 1 [is optional]

req1:on giving input, i want the output to get redirected to a file output.txt(output redirection)

	cat 1> output.txt
provide input to file 
	cat output.txt

	to append and redirect
	cat 1>>output.txt
now add data and it will get updated in that output.txt file

error redirection:
==================
symbol used > >>
error device representing : 2[is must]

cal 15 2021 2>error.txt

update error file[append existing file]
cal 21 2902 2>>error.txt


input redirection:
==================
input can be coming from a file 

symbol : <
number representing : 0[is optional]

read input from a file
cat 0<input.txt


input and output redirection
cat 0<input.txt 1>output.txt

a and 1 are optional
	
	

redirecting output from one terminal to other terminal

cat input.txt > /dev/pts/1[giving path from 2nd terminal ]

echo "hello" > location[/dev/pts/1]


tty - gives file name of terminal , by using this we are transferring from one terminal to other termina
