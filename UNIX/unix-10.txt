grep - global regular expression pattern
This is used for searching a required pattern in a file

grep "Chennai" cities
gives number of lines the content is matching


1.grep "chennai" cities  [chennai here is pattern we want to match]

2.grep command options

	-i   -->  grep -i "delhi" cities    [ignores case senstivity]
	-n   -->  grep -n "DELHI" cities 	[gives line number and search pattern ]
	-c   -->  grep -c "delhi" cities 	[gives count , number of times it is matching]
	-v   -->  grep -v "delhi" cities	[displays lines other than matching pattern]
	-l   --> grep -l "delhi" cities cities1	[display fileNames that contain delhi in it ]

3.display lines that start with 'D'
	^ = represents starting of line
	grep '^D' cities 

4.display lines end with 'i'
	$ = represents end of line
	grep 'i$' cities

5.display all lines that end with 'bad'
	grep 'bad$' cities

6.display all lines that contain any of letters A,B,C,D
	grep '[A-D]' cities
	grep '[ABCD]' cities

7.display all lines that contain any of letters A,B,C,D....Z
	grep '[A-Z]' cities

8.search vowels in file a,e,i,o,u
	grep '[aeiou]' cities

9.search consonants in file 
	grep '[^aeiou]' cities

10.search for multiple patterns
	-e = search for multiple patterns
	grep -e "delhi" -e "Chennai" cities

	instead of -e we can use egrep[extended grep]
	egrep "(delhi|Chennai)" cities


difference between egrep and grep
	egrep "(delhi|Chennai)" cities  --> egrep considers this as regular expression or pattern
	egrep "(delhi|Chennai)" cities   --> grep command will think the "(delhi|Chennai)" whole as a single search pattern

	egrep understands all patterns
	grep '^D' cities 
	egrep '^D' cities ,  both understand it same

-F = search for fixed strings(No pattern) , helps to search multiple patterns
	grep -F "Delhi
		Mumbai
		Hyderabad" cities
	
	press enter after every pattern

Instead of F we can use fgrep command (Fixed String Global Regular Expression pattern)
fgrep "Delhi
	Mumbai
	Hyderabad" cities
fgrep cannot understand pattern only understand strings

====================================================================================================================================
grep with piping:

1.cat cities | grep "Delhi"
displays the lines that has Delhi

2.filenames start with emp
ls -l | grep '^emp'

3.find files that cities in their fileName
ls -l|grep 'cities'

4.find files that cities in their fileName and then display number of filenames matching
ls -l | grep 'cities' | wc -l

5.ls cities | xargs wc
