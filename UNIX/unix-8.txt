Piping:
we can pass output of one command as input for next command is called piping

using piping multiple commands work together
we can use piping using vertical bar(|)

command1 --> output --> command2 --> final output

ls -l /etc | wc -l [gives number of lines]

ls -l /etc | more

ls -l /etc | head -5 

ls -l /etc > output.txt | wc


in middle of piping if we use redirection then it breaks piping


tee: output of first command is saved in output.txt and the same is passed to next
ls -l /etc | tee output.txt | wc



tests.txt contains filenames .read file names from tests.txt and remove each file


output of first command converted into arguments for second command using xarfs
cat tests.txt | xargs rm
