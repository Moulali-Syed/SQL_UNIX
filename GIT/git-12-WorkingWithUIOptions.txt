how to work with eclispe and intellij with git:

create a github repo and copy the remote repo url
create a new file in it


Now clone the github repo to eclipse

2.select Git - projects from GIT -Next
3.Select Clone URI
4.provide remote repo url
5.next
6.next
7.import as general project
8.next
9.finish


now u can do modifications or add some code
it is not part of local repo
we  have to stage - commit - push to remote repo

Right click on file -->Team -->Add to Index
Rightclick on file --> Team --> Commit
it will open a window as unstaged changes | staged changes | Commit message[give commit message]
Then select commit and push if u want to push code to remote repo
or select commit to only push code to local repo
Now it will ask for username and password and login

we will get window as pushed to repo - origin

now open and check the github repo and we can see the code changes there


now if we have made any changes or some one done changes we want them in our local repo
Then we have to do pull
Right click on project --> team --> Pull
