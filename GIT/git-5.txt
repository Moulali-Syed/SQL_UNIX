git checkout command
 we can use checkout command to discard unstaged chnages in tracked files of working directory


1.only for working directory
2.to discard unstaged changes(The changes which are not added to staging area)
3.in the tracked files(files which are already added to staging area/commit)

checkout is used as undo command

lets create a folder , create a new file file.txt with content 
first line 
second line

lets create git repo - git init
git add .
now file is staged
now commit git commit -m "firstcommit"
now file.txt is a tracked file

now lets open file file1.txt
and add content 
this is third line
this is fourth line

now these two lines are not part of staged changes, these are unstaged and now i want to discard these additional 2 lines
 git checkout -- file1.txt

now the 2 lines will be discarded

checkout command is applicable only for tracked files , but not untracked files
