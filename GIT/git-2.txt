install git
download git , download software , install git

once installed search git 

open git bash 
all linux commands work here

create a project folder  and in gitbash go to that location
create file in a.txt , b.txt in folder

in gitbash write ls - it shows files
now we have to create a local repo , to move code from our workspace to local repo

1.write --> git init
this initialize git repository , creates a .git file [a hidden file, like empty repo]

2.git status
shows the files , and info about tracked , untracked

3.add to staging area
 git add a.txt b.txt
	or
 git add .

4.then check -->  git status
	thus we can see they are staged , tracked

for first time we must do below
5.git config --global user.email "abc@gmail.com"
  git config --global user.name "Name"

6.to move files to local repo
	git commit -m "this is a first commit to new repo"
  this moves files to local repo

7. on checking git status 
	we can see on branch master , nothing to commit , working tree  clean

8.git log
	this command shows how many commits were done , time of commit , commit code , who commited person mailId


if we add text in a.txt --> if we check git status then it will show unstaged files
Then we have to do
git add a.txt
git commit -m "comment"

or

git commit -a -m "comment"
