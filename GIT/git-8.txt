master branch will have the main code
if any bug fix is there we create a feature branch , fix and combine that code with master branch


merging can be done in 2 ways
1.fast forward merge:
we only make changes in child branches but not in master branch and then we merge code , thus no issue of getting merge conflicts

2.Three way merge:

	master branch we have commits and also we have commits in feature branch
	mostly merge conflicts occur here


fast forward merge:
master --> a.txt , b.txt
git add a.txt;git commit -m "C1M"
git add b.txt;git commit -m "C2M"
git log --oneline

feature branch 
git branch feature

git branch
feature
*master

git checkout feature
git feature
*feature
master

touch x.txt y.txt
git add x.txt ; git commit -m "C1F"
git add y.txt ; git commit -m "C2F"

ls 
we have 4 files
a.txt b.txt x.txt y.txt

Now lets merge feature branch , with master branch
_________________________________________________
1st switch to master
git checkout master
git merge feature  [git merge branchName]

thus no conflicts

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Three way merge:
master branch new files will be added , feature branch files will be added , at last we merge , merge conflict may arise


create  a folder
git init
touch a.txt b.txt
git add a.txt ; git commit -m "C1M"
git add b.txt ; git commit -m "C2M"

git log --oneline
we can see 2 commits
master - 2 files 2 commits were done

create a child branch
git branch feature
git checkout feature
touch x.txt y.txt
git add x.txt;git commit -m "C1F"
git add y.txt;git commit -m "C2F"
in feature branch we have 4 files and 4 commits


now switch to master branch
git checkout branch
git log --oneline
only 2 committed files we have

touch c.txt
git add c.txt
git commit -m "C3M"


now we have 3 files in master
4 in feature branch
now lets merge both

git merge feature[git merge branchName]
as this is a three way merge it will open a editor
do
:wq
three way merge is nothing but recursive strategy
a new commit will be displayed that will be done by git
we can see using
git log --online
