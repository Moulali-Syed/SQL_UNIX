Removing files by using git rm command:


lets create a folder with 3 files as file1,file2,file3

add them to staging
git init [create empty git repo]
git add .[staged]
git commit -m "3 files commited"[commited to local repo]

ls
shows files in current directory

git ls-files
shows files in the staging area

1.to remove files from both staging and working directory
	git rm file1.txt
	file1 will be removed from working and staging area

2.remove all files from staging and working dir
	git rm -r .

3.remove files from only staging but not from working directory
 	git rm --cached file2.txt
	now u can check git ls-files , it will be removed

4.remove files only from working dir
	rm file3.txt
